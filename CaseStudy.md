I would like to select eBay (option #12) as my case study. 
I am curious about how they were able to handle all of that traffic, as well as how they managed to increase their productivity via microservice architecture despite that.
As for my more personal reasons, I find eBay to a rather interesting phenomenon. I have a mild interest in the business side of the internet as well. I believe that all of
these combined would allow me to learn interesting things about e-commerce, which would hopefully lead to a in-depth case study.
