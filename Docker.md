I had to download a multitude of things to get Docker Desktop running, such as Docker itself, a kernel update, and Ubuntu. After that, I wasn’t even able to create a container, for some strange reason involving the docker daemon. After searching the internet for solutions and fiddling around with them, I was finally able to create a container, which in this case is the docker/getting-started image. 

I think the big difference between Docker and the box I’m using is that the box doesn’t have Docker’s built in images. When I entered the command to create a container, it stated that it was unable to find the container locally, then pulled it from somewhere. Although I am unsure of the exact location it pulled it from, I am fairly certain that it has to do with Docker’s services.
