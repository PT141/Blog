 State what the advantages of Virtual Machines are \n
  Fast to create and destroy
  Programmable
    Can be orchestrated via software
  Can be moved to another physical machine
  Allowed to emulate at a chip and device level
 
 State what the advantages of containers are
  Less wasteful than VM
  Changes affect all the processes (memory limit, disk bandwidth)
  Can affect other processes in the same container
  Do not require an entire operating system
  
 
 State when you might select physical machines over virtual machines
  When you have one process that needs many cores or generates a huge amount of network traffic
  Multiple processes that need CPU time
  Not a lot of disk space available
  
 I think the cloud would aid microservices by allowing users to access a or update a microservice whenever and wherever they want. Microservice architecture allows worker to isolate a problem
 and quickly fix it. Cloud storage would just streamline that process by allowing the worker to access it and fix the issue whenever. The company would also not have to worry about
 a machine breaking down, as it would just save to the cloud. Combined with the fact that microservice architecture doesn't entirely break down when something breaks means that the
 company does not need to worry about the entire application going down.
 
 Another way the cloud would aid microservices is keeping the costs down. Microservices are more expensive than macroservices, but the cloud helps keep the cost down. An expensive
 machine isn't needed to store anything, as it is stored in the cloud. Another way the cloud keeps costs down is by allowing companies to forego a personal server. Cloud services
 would let companies save money and make the jump to microservices much easier.
