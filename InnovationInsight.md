Note 1

This note compares microservices and miniservices. They're both similar in their requirements and properties, but there is a big difference between them, which in turn, leads to more differences. They both require microservice architecture and are based on the same architectural principles. On the other hand, the big difference in this case is that miniservices are more relaxed than microservices, which would normally require strict constraints to ensure that the different components are as indepedent as possible. The more inconvienent principles, patterns, or constraints of microservices are more flexible in miniservices, which sacrifices some agility and adaptability. 

Note 2

This note explains what macroservices are. They are the traditional architecture and uses monolithic applications, usually stored within an application server. They are not cloud-native or suited for containers. They also do not require microservice architecture, unlike the other two. One similarity between macroservices and microservices is that they are both accessed with the same type of API.
